CODECHALLENGE
#
This is a react app hosted in vercel, it has 5 mini applications inside, all related to arrays.
As I said it is a React App, I wanted to try something new for my experience and decided to use State Hooks,
it is a single page web app but with state I managed to make it look like a multi page web app.


ARRAY ORDER
#
This will alphabetical order a string array.


ANAGRAM EXERCISE
#
This will transform two strings into arrays, then it will rearrange them and will compare if they are Anagrams or Not.
It has onChange function so no buttons required to use it, just type everything you want.


NAME PAIR
#
This pairs two input names randomically, if the number are odd, then it will make an half pair.


My favourite honestly || DNArrays it will combine Arrays into one but it will pick strings.

Contact List 
#
It is a Contact List, pretty straightforward, however you can select some of the contacts and mark them as favourite, it has a searchbox and works for marked and unmarked ones.
