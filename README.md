CODECHALLENGE
#
This is a react app hosted in vercel, it has 5 mini applications inside, all related to arrays.
As I said it is a React App, I wanted to try something new for my experience and decided to use State Hooks,
it is a single page web app but with state I managed to make it look like a multi page web app.

USAGE
#
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#
ARRAY ORDER
* This will alphabetical order a string array.

#
ANAGRAM EXERCISE
 * This will transform two strings into arrays, then it will rearrange them and will compare if they are Anagrams or Not.
It has onChange function so no buttons required to use it, just type everything you want.

#
NAME PAIR
* This pairs two input names randomically, if the number are odd, then it will make an half pair.

#
DNArrays
* It will combine Arrays into one but it will pick strings.

#
CONTACT LIST
* It is a Contact List, pretty straightforward, however you can select some of the contacts and mark them as favourite, it has a searchbox and works for marked and unmarked ones.
